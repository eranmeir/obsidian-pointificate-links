# Pointificate Links

A simple plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) that decodes URL encoded links and encloses them in pointy (angled) brackets, which are more readable and comply with the [CommonMark spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/).

Running the command `Pointificate Links: Decode links and enclose in pointy brackets` will replace all links in the currently open document.
